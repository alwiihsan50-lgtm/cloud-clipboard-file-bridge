# API Contract

Base URL:

```text
https://ajlkfzgpheegmwsnspxw.supabase.co/functions/v1/cloudbridge
```

Protected endpoints require either the admin token or a paired device token:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <CLOUD_BRIDGE_TOKEN>
```

## Realtime Broadcast

Realtime channel:

```text
cloudbridge
```

Event:

```text
cloudbridge_change
```

Payload examples:

```json
{
  "kind": "clipboard",
  "id": "uuid",
  "version": 14,
  "source": "ios-pwa",
  "device_id": "ios-device-id"
}
```

```json
{
  "kind": "file",
  "id": "uuid",
  "filename": "photo.jpg",
  "source": "ios-pwa",
  "device_id": "ios-device-id"
}
```

Realtime payloads are signals only. Clipboard content and file payloads are fetched through the protected API.

## `GET /health`

Public health check.

Response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "service": "CloudBridge",
  "mode": "supabase-edge"
}
```

## `POST /api/pairing/create`

Admin-only endpoint used by Windows tray app to create a short-lived pairing link.

Request:

```json
{
  "device_id": "windows-main",
  "label": "Windows PC"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "code": "short-lived-secret",
  "pairing_url": "https://ajlkfzgpheegmwsnspxw.supabase.co/functions/v1/cloudbridge/app?code=short-lived-secret",
  "expires_at": "2026-07-14T03:10:00+00:00"
}
```

The Windows tray app uses `code` to build the iPhone app URL:

```text
https://alwiihsan50-lgtm.github.io/cloud-clipboard-file-bridge/app/?code=short-lived-secret
```

## `POST /api/pairing/claim`

Public endpoint used by the iPhone PWA to exchange a pairing code for a device token.

Request:

```json
{
  "code": "short-lived-secret",
  "device_id": "ios-device-id",
  "label": "iPhone",
  "platform": "ios"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "device_id": "ios-device-id",
  "token": "device-token"
}
```

`platform` is optional. The iPhone PWA sends `ios`; the Windows tray auto-manager flow sends `windows-web`. The returned token is only shown once to the client; the database stores its SHA-256 hash in `cloudbridge_devices`.

## `GET /api/me`

Validates the current admin/device token.

## `POST /api/clipboard/push`

Push latest clipboard text.

Request:

```json
{
  "content": "text to sync",
  "source": "ios",
  "device_id": "iphone-alwi"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "item": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "content": "text to sync",
    "source": "ios",
    "version": 1,
    "created_at": "2026-07-14T03:00:00+00:00",
    "device_id": "iphone-alwi",
    "pinned": false,
    "pinned_at": null,
    "pinned_by_device_id": null
  }
}
```

## `GET /api/clipboard/latest`

Query params:

- `device_id`: current device id; prevents echoing its own clipboard.
- `since_id`: last seen clipboard record id.

Response with update:

```json
{

  "item": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "content": "latest text",
    "source": "windows",
    "version": 2,
    "created_at": "2026-07-14T03:01:00+00:00",
    "device_id": "windows-pc"
  }
}
```

Response without update:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "has_update": false,

```

## `GET /api/clipboard/history`

Returns recent clipboard records for the manager UI.

Query params:

- `limit`: optional, default `50`, max `100`.

Response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "content": "latest text",
      "source": "windows",
      "device_id": "windows-pc",

      "pinned_by_device_id": null
    }
  ]
}
```

## `POST /api/clipboard/{id}/pin`

Marks a clipboard record as pinned so automatic cleanup will not delete it.

## `POST /api/clipboard/{id}/unpin`

Removes the pinned status from a clipboard record.

## `POST /api/files/upload`

Multipart form request:

- `file`: uploaded file.
- `source`: `ios-pwa` or `windows-tray`.
- `device_id`: sender device id.
- `folder_id`: optional destination folder UUID. Omit it to upload into `Inbox`.

Response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "item": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "filename": "photo.jpg",
    "size": 12345,
    "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
    "source": "ios",
    "device_id": "iphone-alwi",
    "uploaded_at": "2026-07-14T03:02:00+00:00",
    "status": "pending",
    "downloaded_at": null,

    "pinned_at": null,
    "pinned_by_device_id": null
  }
}
```

## `GET /api/files/pending`

Response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,

}
```

## `GET /api/files/{id}/download`

Downloads the file binary. The iPhone PWA uses this endpoint for files uploaded from Windows.

## `POST /api/files/{id}/ack`

Response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "item": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "filename": "photo.jpg",
    "size": 12345,
    "mime_type": "image/jpeg",

    "pinned_at": null,
    "pinned_by_device_id": null
  }
}
```

## `GET /api/files/history`

Returns recent file records for the manager UI. The response does not expose `storage_path`.

Query params:

- `limit`: optional, default `50`, max `100`.

## `POST /api/files/{id}/pin`

Marks a file as pinned so automatic cleanup will not delete the row or storage object.

## `POST /api/files/{id}/unpin`

Removes the pinned status from a file.

## File manager endpoints

### `GET /api/file-folders/tree`

Returns every active folder as a flat tree source. Each folder contains `id`, `name`, `parent_id`, and timestamps.

### `POST /api/file-folders`

Creates a folder. JSON body: `{ "name": "Project", "parent_id": null }`. `parent_id` may reference another active folder.

### `PATCH /api/file-folders/{id}`

Renames or moves a folder with `name` and/or `parent_id`. Moving a folder into itself or one of its descendants is rejected.

### Folder lifecycle

- `POST /api/file-folders/{id}/trash` moves the full subtree and its files to Trash.
- `POST /api/file-folders/{id}/restore` restores the subtree. A conflicting root name receives a numeric suffix.
- `DELETE /api/file-folders/{id}` permanently deletes a trashed subtree and its Storage objects.

### `GET /api/files/browse`

Browses one location with `folder_id=root`, `folder_id=inbox`, or a folder UUID. Optional `sort` values are `newest`, `oldest`, `name`, and `size`.

### `GET /api/files/search`

Searches active folders and files by `q`. Queries shorter than two characters return an empty result.

### `GET /api/files/trash`

Returns top-level trashed folders and standalone trashed files. Nested contents remain attached to their trashed parent folder.

### `GET /api/files/storage`

Returns `used_bytes`, the configured `quota_bytes`, and `usage_ratio` for the manager storage meter.

### `GET /api/files/workspace`

Returns the folder tree, children and files for one location, Inbox count, pagination state, and aggregate storage usage in one response.

Query params:

- `folder_id`: `root`, `inbox`, `trash`, or a folder UUID.
- `sort`: `newest`, `oldest`, `name`, or `size`.
- `limit`: default `30`, max `50`.
- `offset`: default `0`, max `10000`.

The response includes `has_more` and `next_offset`. Existing browse, tree, trash, and storage endpoints remain available for older clients.

### `PATCH /api/files/{id}`

Renames an active file. The Storage object path remains private and is never returned.

### `POST /api/files/bulk`

Applies one action to 1-100 file IDs. JSON fields:

```json
{
  "ids": ["uuid"],
  "action": "move",
  "folder_id": "inbox"
}
```

Supported actions: `move`, `pin`, `unpin`, `trash`, `restore`, and `delete_permanently`. Permanent deletion is accepted only for trashed files.

## Quick Actions

### `POST /api/quick-actions/setup`

Requires a full device token. Creates or rotates one child token with scope `clipboard_quick`. The plaintext token is returned once with `push_url` and `pull_url`.

### `DELETE /api/quick-actions/setup`

Requires the parent full device token and revokes its Quick Actions token.

### `POST /api/quick/clipboard/push`

Requires a `clipboard_quick` token. JSON body: `{ "content": "text" }`. Empty content is rejected and the maximum UTF-8 payload is 1 MB. The server records source `ios-shortcut` and broadcasts a Realtime clipboard signal.

### `GET /api/quick/clipboard/pull`

Requires a `clipboard_quick` token. Returns the latest clipboard content from another device as `text/plain`, or HTTP `204` when none exists.

Quick tokens may call only these clipboard endpoints and `/api/me`. Every other protected endpoint returns `403`.

## `POST /api/cleanup`

Admin-only manual cleanup endpoint.

Cleanup policy:

- Deletes unpinned clipboard records older than 7 days.
- Deletes unpinned Inbox files after the temporary transfer retention window.
- Deletes items left in Trash for 7 days.
- Deletes file objects from `cloudbridge-files` before deleting file rows.
- Never deletes pinned clipboard or pinned files.
- Does not expire active files stored inside user folders.

## Conflict Rules

- Clipboard uses last-write-wins based on server write order.
- `version` increments on every clipboard push.
- Clients should pass `device_id` and `since_id` to avoid receiving stale records or their own writes.
- File records are independent and do not conflict; every upload creates a new pending item.
